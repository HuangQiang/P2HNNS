### Primary Changes

1. We add **template** for the source codes and move the source codes to the `methods/` folder.
2. We fix some bugs in NH and FH.
3. We modify the format of the datasets: add one more dimension with 1 for each data point for simplicity.
4. We upload the complete datasets and hyperplane queries to [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aBFV4feZcLnQkDR7tjC-Kj7g3MpfBqv7?usp=sharing) (One can also download all of them from the datasets link in README.md).
